Client 0            Client 1             Server 

Create player 0     Create player 0     Create Player {0 : {0, 0}}
                                        Create Player {1 : {0, 1}}

                                        Update(0) of server_entity(1)

?? Is there just a way to snapshot game state in a reasonable way ??

                                         { 1, 1,      <ship>       }
                                         { 2, server, <asteroid>   }
                                         { 3, server, <asteroid>   }
                                         { 4, 1,      <projectile> }

Can i just snapshot relevant ECS data?
