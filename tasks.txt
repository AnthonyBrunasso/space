Asteroids

When commands are send to clients via SendRecepientFullGameState
entities begin to conflict. As in a command is sent to create asteroid
with entity 1 but entity 1 may exist already on that client and
furthermore the clients "free" entity list is not properly updated.

Now that commands come in entities that exist are properly CREATED
on the client but they are not in the correct position. I think this
is ok and will be addressed when components become synchable between
client / server.
