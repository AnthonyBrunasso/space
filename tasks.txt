Rendering
[] Create interface for rendering stuff - I think this should be pretty
   simple to start. Implements some draw calls -
      [] DrawLine(LineComponent)
      [] DrawTriangle(TriangleComponent)
      

Testing
[] Use gtest in ecs_test instead of catch.
[] Use gtest in search_test instead of catch.
[] Use gtest in math_test instead of catch.
[] Use gtest in game_test instead of catch.
[] Remove catch submodule.
