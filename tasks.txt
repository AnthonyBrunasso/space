Rendering
[] Create interface for rendering stuff - I think this should be pretty
   simple to start. Implements some draw calls -
      [] DrawLine(LineComponent)
      [] DrawTriangle(TriangleComponent)
[x] Create cache for compiling / linking and saving shader / program refs.      
[] Create a gl_program abstraction. This will take a validly linked program
from gl_shader_cache and load its program info through GetProgramInfo.
It will expose the calls to set attributes in the shader and will check
that they are in the program before setting them.

Testing
[] Use gtest in ecs_test instead of catch.
[] Use gtest in search_test instead of catch.
[x] Use gtest in math_test instead of catch.
[] Use gtest in game_test instead of catch.
[] Remove catch submodule.

Misc
[] Return meaningful status objects from calls where important. I
return booleans now but it'd be useful to return some sort of status
object that can give more information on what went wrong.
