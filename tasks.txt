Testing
[] Use gtest in ecs_test instead of catch.
[] Use gtest in search_test instead of catch.
[] Remove catch submodule.

Network
  [] Server outgoing message queue should be better abstracted. It
     should have N outgoing clients to send messages to but only
     allocates for a packet once. Enqueing should be something like -
     
          outgoing_queue.Enqueue( { clients }, msg )

Demos
  [] Asteroids
      
       [] Update clients with postional updates of other clients.

Misc
[] Create some more meaningful units that things move around in. Right
now everything is in regards to opengl's coordinate system
