Rendering
[] Create interface for rendering stuff - I think this should be pretty
   simple to start. Implements some draw calls -
      [] DrawLine(LineComponent)
      [] DrawTriangle(TriangleComponent)
[x] Create cache for compiling / linking and saving shader / program refs.      

Testing
[] Use gtest in ecs_test instead of catch.
[] Use gtest in search_test instead of catch.
[] Use gtest in math_test instead of catch.
[] Use gtest in game_test instead of catch.
[] Remove catch submodule.

Misc
[] Return meaningful status objects from calls where important. I
return booleans now but it'd be useful to return some sort of status
object that can give more information on what went wrong.
