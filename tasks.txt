This document is meant to give you and I some context into what the other is working
on and what we believe need to be done in the future. This is not meant to be an
exhaustive list but instead provide you and I the means to work independently on items
without duplicating work.

The format for each line item is [user]: <Description>

If a line item has a <Description> and no [user] that means one of us believes this task
should be done but are not actively working on it.

Delete items when they are done.

---------- TASKS ---------- 

gameplay -

sound -

  : Develop a system for playing audio / sound files. I think we should do our best to
    minimize external dependencies for the sake of build time / complexity but would
    not be surprised if we had to adopt one for this task.

AI -

  anthony: Apply pathfinding to moving squares on screen. A* has been repurposed from
           4x to accomplish this so this will mostly be defining a graph that units
           can use the develop paths.

engine - 

  anthony: Flip coordinate system to have positive y-axis pointing up on the screen.
           Currently pixel space is being used directly as world space.
  anthony: Introduce a world space.
  anthony: Use 16:9 aspect ratio when scaling. Currently we are using pixel width and
           height when performing an orthographic projection. This has the nice property
           that squares remain squares under 
  anthony: Render a graph. By default this should be a graph showing our world space.
           as in the width / height of each square will be our 'meter'.
  anthony: Implement texture rendering. This should be as simple as attaching a component
           to an entity with some ID to represent the texture.
  anthony: Primitive UI, start with a square in world space that represents a button.
